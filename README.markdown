# PassyVM [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/passy/passyvm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/passy/passyvm)

A minimal virtual machine to get my toes wet with Rust. It's probably not even
gonna build, let alone do anything useful. You're probably well adviced to just
hit the back button and pretend you've never seen this repo.

## Setup

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
